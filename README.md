## Project Structure

- **app.py**  
  A Streamlit-based web application for entering text and getting next-word predictions.
  
- **lstm_experiment.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter notebook showcasing LSTM model training and experimentation.

- **next_word_lstm.h5**  
  The trained LSTM model saved in HDF5 format.

- **tokenizer.pickle**  
  The tokenizer object used for preprocessing input text.

- **hamlet.txt**  
  A text dataset (likely Shakespeareâ€™s *Hamlet*) used for training purposes.

- **requirements.txt**  
  A list of required Python libraries and dependencies.
